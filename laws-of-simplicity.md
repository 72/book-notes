### The Laws of Simplicity


### Reduce
> The simplest way to achieve simplicity is through thoughtful reduction.

- The easiest way to simplify a system is to remove functionality.
- How simple can you make it? _versus_ How complex does it have to be?

---

### Organize
> Organization makes a system of many appear fewer.

- Typical solutions have mixed results.
  - The greater space enables more clutter.
  - The storage route increases the amount of empty space, but it can be immediately filled in with more stuff that will need to go into storage. (Hamburger Menu metaphor?)
- Questions to ask in the de-complicating procedure:
  - "What to hide?"
  - "Where to put it?"
  - "What goes with what?"
- This helps bring structure to the chaos, as long as the organizing principles can be obeyed.
- This will only hold if the number of groups is significantly less than the number of items to be organized.

### Time
> Savings in time feel like simplicity.

- Waiting is subtle. When forced to wait, life seems unnecessarily complex.
- When any interaction happens quickly, we attribute this efficiency to the perceived simplicity of experience.

### Learn
> Knowledge makes everything simpler.




### Differences
> Simplicity and complexity need each other.

### Context
> What lies in the periphery of simplicity is definitely not peripheral.

### Emotion
> More emotions are better than less.

### Trust
> In simplicity we trust.

### Failure
> Some things can never be made simple.

### The one
> Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful.
