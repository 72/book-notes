# The Laws of Simplicity

This is the structure I'm following:

### The Laws of Simplicity

---

### Reduce
> The simplest way to achieve simplicity is through thoughtful reduction.

- The easiest way to simplify a system is to remove functionality.
- How simple can you make it? _versus_ How complex does it have to be?

---

### Organize
> Organization makes a system of many appear fewer.

- Typical solutions have mixed results.
  - The greater space enables more clutter.
  - The storage route increases the amount of empty space, but it can be immediately filled in with more stuff that will need to go into storage. (Hamburger Menu metaphor?)
- Questions to ask in the de-complicating procedure:
  - "What to hide?"
  - "Where to put it?"
  - "What goes with what?"
- This helps bring structure to the chaos, as long as the organizing principles can be obeyed.
- This will only hold if the number of groups is significantly less than the number of items to be organized.

### Time
> Savings in time feel like simplicity.

- Waiting is subtle. When forced to wait, life seems unnecessarily complex.
- When any interaction happens quickly, we attribute this efficiency to the perceived simplicity of experience.

---

### Learn
> Knowledge makes everything simpler.

-  "The problem with taking time to learn a task is that you often feel you are wasting time, a violation of the third Law."
(Not sure if I agree with anything stated under this law.)

### Differences
> Simplicity and complexity need each other.

- Nobody wants to have only simplicity.
- Without the counterpoint of complexity, we could not recognize simplicity when we see it.
- We know how to appreciate something better when we can compare it to something else. (I don't like the implications of this idea)
- There is a clear economic benefit to adopting a strategy of simplicity that will help set your product apart. (ugh...)

### Context
> What lies in the periphery of simplicity is definitely not peripheral.

- Focus isn't always a good thing. (Disagree. Unfortunate way to try to make a point.)
- Goal: "Finding the meaning of everything around, instead of just what I directly faced."


### Emotion
> More emotions are better than less.

- When emotions are considered above everything else, don't be afraid to add more ornament or layers of meaning.
(Totally disagree with the assumption of 'more ornament' to 'more emotion/meaning'. His example of 'people who like bling instead of simple things' is particularly misleading and it's misreading the situation.)

### Trust
> In simplicity we trust.

- Every day the computer becomes increasingly smarter. It already knows your name, address, and credit card number. (What?)
- Trust is the price of not having to think. (ugh...)

### Failure
> Some things can never be made simple.

- Leverages an unfortunate event to radically shift perspective.
- One person's failed experiment in simplicity can be another person's success as a beautiful form of complexity.
- Deeming something as complex or simple requires a frame of reference.

### The one
> Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful.

- Ten laws (10: one, zero), remove none (0: zero), and you're left with one (10: one). When in doubt, turn to the tenth Law: the one. It's simpler that way.
(An unnecesary law. I'd have removed it for the sake of simplicity.)
