### Intro: Lost and Found

[...] acknowledge we will always have problems, many of them hidden from our view; that we work hard to uncover these problems, even if doing so means making ourselves uncomfortable; and that, when we come across a problem, we marshal all of our energies to solve it.

_

We had put our faith in a simple idea: If we made something that we wanted to see, others would want to see it, too.

_

achieving the goal that had defined my professional life had left me without one.

I’d spent two decades building a train and laying its track. Now, the thought of merely driving it struck me as a far less interesting task.

_

Gradually, a pattern began to emerge: Someone had a creative idea, obtained funding, brought on a lot of smart people, and developed and sold a product that got a boatload of attention.

[...] the leaders of these companies seemed so focused on the competition that they never developed any deep introspection about other destructive forces that were at work.

I began to see my role as a leader more clearly. I would devote myself to learning how to build not just a successful company but a sustainable creative culture.

The thesis of this book is that there are many blocks to creativity, but there are active steps we can take to protect the creative process.

I believe the best managers acknowledge and make room for what they do not know, not just because humility is a virtue but because until one adopts that mindset, the most striking breakthroughs cannot occur.

When it comes to creative inspiration, job titles and hierarchy are meaningless.

Sincerely believing that we were in an inclusive meeting, we saw nothing amiss because we didn’t feel excluded.

Often, finding a solution is a multi-step endeavor. There is the problem you know you are trying to solve, think of that as an oak tree, and then there are all the other problems, think of these as saplings, that sprouted from the acorns that fell around it. And these problems remain after you cut the oak tree down.

[...] the key to solving these problems is finding ways to see what’s working and what isn’t, which sounds a lot simpler than it is.

Every time some technological breakthrough occurred, Walt Disney incorporated it and then talked about it on his show in a way that highlighted the relationship between technology and art. I was too young to realize such a synergy was groundbreaking. To me, it just made sense that they belonged together.

_

Throughout my life, people have always smiled when I told them I switched from art to physics because it seems, to them, like such an incongruous leap. But my decision to pursue physics, and not art, would lead me, indirectly, to my true calling.

Making pictures with a computer spoke to both sides of my brain.

_

The leaders of my department understood that to create a fertile laboratory, they had to assemble different kinds of thinkers and then encourage their autonomy.

_

[...] each time I expressed that goal in job interviews at universities, it seemed to cast a pall over the room. “But we want you to teach computer science,” my interviewers would say. What I was proposing to do looked, to most academics, like a pipe dream, an expensive fantasy.
